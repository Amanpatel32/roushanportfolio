# EmailJS Setup for Contact Form - COMPLETED âœ…

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Install @emailjs/browser package
- [x] Update ContactForm.tsx to use EmailJS instead of fetch
- [x] Fix TypeScript compatibility issues
- [x] Configure EmailJS with your credentials:
  - Service ID: service_fzaljd7
  - Template ID: template_zj9347w
  - Public Key: ufvw8LGCqjg3-a0dQ

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Contact Form

### Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test the Contact Form
1. Navigate to the Contact page in your browser
2. Fill out all fields in the contact form
3. Click "Send Message"
4. You should see a success message: "Message sent successfully! I'll get back to you soon."
5. Check your email (roushanpateldata@gmail.com) for the new message

## Troubleshooting
- If emails don't send, check the browser console for errors
- Ensure your EmailJS service is properly connected and active
- Make sure your email template variables match: `{{from_name}}`, `{{from_email}}`, `{{subject}}`, `{{message}}`

## Security Note
The public key is safe to use in frontend code, but keep your service and template IDs secure.

Your contact form is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
